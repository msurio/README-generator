# README-generator

## Installation
    Clone the Repo:
    ```git clone git@github.com:msurio/README-generator.git```

    Install the dependencies to run application:
    ```npm install```

    To run the application:
    ```node index.js```

## Usage:
When you run ```node index.js```, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.

The application then takes your responses. From there, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts. The, fs.writeFile is used to generate your project's README.md file.
